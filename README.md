# Websites on SommerKim.github.io

### Weather Analysis Website
The website at Sommer.github.io/index.html features data and data visualizations that were created in a study of weather patterns as they relate to latitudinal location. This is a report of findings from the weather-analysis project on this github profile.

This website is constructed with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap in order to showcase scatter static plots that depict wind speeds, max temperatures, cloudiness and humidity by city. The data is available to the viewer by way of an embedded responsive HTML table. Each plot has its own page with a corresponding summary of the data. Each plot has its own page showcasing a larger view of the data along with an explanatory summary. From the navbar, a visitor can navigate to any page in the website directly. 

Some accessibility controls have been added to aid e-readers, and the site layout adjusts to accommodate different sized screens.

### Bellybutton Biodiversity Website
The website at SommerKim.github.io/plotly-challenge/index.html displays responsive graphs created with Plotly and Javascript that allow the user to explore data from a study on the microbes found in belly buttons. (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) The dashboard provides an easy way to view microbe levels by individual test subject. The user can choose a test subject number in the drop-down and see two visualizations depicting the microbe populations for that individual. The informational panel will populate with the relevant information for that test subject as well.
