# Web-Design-Challenge

This website features data and data visualizations that were created in a study of weather patterns as they relate to latitudinal location. 

This website is constructed with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap in order to showcase scatter plots that depict wind speeds, max temperatures, cloudiness and humidity by city. The data is available to the viewer by way of an embedded responsive HTML table. Each plot has its own page with a corresponding summary of the data. Each plot has its own page showcasing a larger view of the data along with an explanatory summary. From the navbar, a visitor can navigate to any page in the website directly. 

Some accessibility controls have been added to aid e-readers, and the site layout adjusts to accommodate different sized screens.
